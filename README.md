## Who am I?
Hello, dear reader! 

My name is Jingyiran Li. I go by Sophia. I was born and raised in the South hence I am particularly fond of summer sports like water-skiing, wakeboarding, fishing, and jet-skiing. Furthermore, I am a certified Open Water Diver by PADI. Lastly, I have been learning and practicing visual arts since I was seven years old, therefore I do recreational illustration when I am not engaged in outdoor activities and in academics. 

#### Things that I want to accomplish next:
  1. Learn how to fly a helicopter.
  2. Become a certified skydiver.
  3. Keep a non-succulent plant alive for one year. 
  
#### My favorite quote:
