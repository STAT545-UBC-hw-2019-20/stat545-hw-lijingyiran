```{r}
library(gapminder)
gapdata <- gapminder
```

The structure of this dataset can be found as follows:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
The name of each variables in this dataset as well as the dimension of this dataset can be extracted by:

```{r}
names(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
```


First few rows of the dataset can be displayed:
```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

Classification of the variables present in the gapminder dataset can be obtained by:

```{r}
sapply(gapdata, class)
```

A five-number summary can be computed for the quantitative variables:
```{r}
summary(gapdata[,c(3:6)])
```
